# Machine-Learning

it's a package of some basic machine learning algorithms,

I made it step by step,welcome to give me a hand

there are more information about the code on my blog

# INTRODUCTION

## · 1.linear_model.py

It contains three different kinds of linear models

They are `Linear Regresiion`、`Logistic Regression` and `Linear Discriminant Analysis`

There are more details in :  [detail document about the algorithms](http://blog.csdn.net/liangjun_feng/article/details/77758179)

the result of the py file:

## · 2.decision_Tree.py

It's a `Decision Tree` algorithm's file,and actually, I am not so satisfied with the code 

It's not easy to give the visuable result of the algorithm,if you could help me with the

code and visualable ,it's thankful

## · 3.BP_neural_network.py

The code of the `BP_neural_network`.py is pretty good ,and I test it using the 'xor'

There are more details in :  [detail document about the algorithms](http://blog.csdn.net/liangjun_feng/article/details/78016019)

## · 4.support_vector_machine.py

when i study the `Support Vector Machine` ，I think it a little hard to figure out the 

model. so I use a package of the python to help me complete the code,  And It's shoud be right

There are more details in :  [detail document about the algorithms](http://blog.csdn.net/liangjun_feng/article/details/78046526)

the result of the py file:

## · 5.naive_bayes_classifier.py

I use a famous data set in the `naive bayes classifier` called 'pima-indians-diabetes dataset'

and the accurancy could be 70% when the average is 65% , I give the link to the [set](https://github.com/LiangjunFeng/Machine-Learning/blob/master/pima-indians-diabetes%20dataset),you could try by yourself

There are more details in :  [detail document about the algorithms](http://blog.csdn.net/liangjun_feng/article/details/78057753)

## · 6.AdaBoost.py

I use the same data set with the bayes algorithm in the `AdaBoost`，It shows a greater function than the bayes

and the accuracy could be 82%

There are more details in :  [detail document about the algorithms](http://blog.csdn.net/liangjun_feng/article/details/78123583)

## · 7.K-means.py

The famous clustering algorithm ,`K-means` , It's easy to understand and easy to implement

I test the code by some dots creating by myself

There are more details in :  [detail document about the algorithms](http://blog.csdn.net/Liangjun_Feng/article/details/78154549)

the result of the py file:

## · 8.pca.py

I combine the `pca` and K-means inthis file ,but it's even more diificult to test the fuction

than the decision tree , I make some resluts just for reference, if you have better way, please 

help me ,thank you. and the data set I use is [here](https://github.com/LiangjunFeng/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Epileptic%20Seizure%20Recognition%20Data%20Set.csv) 

the result of the py file:
